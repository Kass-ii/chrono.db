# Introduction (≧◡≦) ♡

Hi, my name is Kassidy Satterfield. I am a student at UT Arlington with a passion for tech. I have a deep understanding of systems, infrastructure, and backend development. I like to build complex tools just to understand them better. Creating new tools and adding anything I can think of is something I genuinely enjoy.

# Why I made ChronoDB (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

At one of my past internships, we used a lot of internal tooling, but we didn’t have a solid understanding of how it actually worked. I personally didn’t like that, because I always want to know how something works. So instead of relying on our existing database tool, I made my own so I could understand every aspect of it and change anything I saw fit. It brings me joy to fully grasp how something complex operates.
