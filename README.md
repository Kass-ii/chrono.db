# Introduction (≧◡≦) ♡

Hi, My name is Kassidy Satterfield. I am a student at UT Arlington, with a passion in tech. I have a deep understanding of system / infrastructure and backend. I like to make complex tools just to understand them. I like building tools and adding on anything new I can think of.

# Why I made ChronoDB (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

At one of my past internships, we used a lot of internal tooling but we didnt have a good enough understanding of how it worked. I personally didnt like that, as I always want to know how something works. So instead of relying on our own database tool, I made my own so I understand every aspect and could change what I saw fit. It's soemthing that brings me joy when I understand how something complex works.
